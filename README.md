 User-Churn-Prediction
=======================================

Churn means "loss of custormers to competition". It is a problem for most service companies because it is more expensive to acquire 
a new customer than to keep your existing one from leaving.

My objective is to develop an algorithm to predict then churn score based on user pattern and analyze the most important factors
that influence customer churn.


### Dataset:
Our dataset is artificial churn data based on claims similar to real world use case. It includes customer usage pattern and 
the information denoting if the customer has churned or not. 

### Introduction:
>- Predict which customers are likely to stop using service

>- Analyze top-k factors that influence user retention

### Machine Learning Process.

>- Data Preprocessing
data cleaning, categorical features transformation. feature
standardization, feature correlation.

>- Model training
Logistic Regression(L1, L2), K-nearest-neightbors, Random Forest, Result evaluation, K-fold cross validation.

>- Data Interpretation - feature selection
>- Tuning prediction result.
